I did my PhD in ancient DNA genomics at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](https://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/index/) in Leipzig where I studied the evolutionary histories of anatomically modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans (but also extinct elephants!).

I'm currently working at the [GLOBE Institute](https://globe.ku.dk) at the University of Copenhagen where I'm building new tools for spatial data analysis and population genomics simulations. The underlying themes of my work are reproducibility and design of intuitive user-programmable interfaces to complex computational methods: I enjoy building tools that help experts work on novel questions more efficiently while lowering the barrier of entry to novice users.

The most recent outcome of my work is an R package [_slendr_](https://github.com/bodkan/slendr) ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=slendr)), which provides a framework for building programmable population genetic simulations on real geographic landscapes, as well as for simulation of traditional non-spatial population genetic models, entirely in R. You can read more about _slendr_ in [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.20.485041v1).

I'm also the developer of [_admixr_](https://github.com/bodkan/admixr) ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=admixr)), an R package for automated, reproducible analyses using the [ADMIXTOOLS](https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools) software. This package has already been used in [several dozen](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=13286994334855947290) of publications and has thousands of users, many of which have had little to no experience with data analysis and programming.
