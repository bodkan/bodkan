## `> whoami`

I'm a [researcher](https://bodkan.net/publications) and [programmer](https://bodkan.net/software) at the [Globe Institute](https://globe.ku.dk), University of Copenhagen, where I develop new tools for spatial simulations and data analysis in population genetics and ecology.

An important focus of my work is facilitating reproducibility through the design of intuitive, programmable interfaces to complex computational methods. I enjoy thinking about ways to help experts work on hard problems more efficiently while lowering the barrier of entry to novice users.

Previously, I did my PhD in ancient DNA genomics at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](https://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/index/) in Leipzig where I studied the evolutionary histories of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and anatomically modern humans (but also extinct elephants!).
