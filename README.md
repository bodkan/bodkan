I’m an assistant professor at the [Globe Institute](https://globe.ku.dk),
University of Copenhagen. The primary focus of my
[research](https://bodkan.net/publications) is on developing computational
methods to address challenging new questions across the broad field of
evolutionary genomics.

Beyond research, I dedicate a lot of time to teaching and mentoring students of
all levels. Helping enthusiastic novice scientists push their projects forward
is one of the most rewarding parts of my job.

I have a PhD in ancient DNA genomics from the [Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Anthropology](https://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/index/) in Leipzig
where I worked on the evolutionary histories of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and
anatomically modern humans. Before doing my PhD, I studied [computer
science](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en) and [molecular
biology](https://natur.cuni.cz/en) at Charles University in Prague&mdash;being
equally excited by both of these fields (and by the prospect of combining them
together one day) as a student all these years ago is what led me to where I
am now.
