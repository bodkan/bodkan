I'm a [researcher](https://bodkan.net/publications) and [programmer](https://bodkan.net/software) at the [Globe Institute](https://globe.ku.dk), University of Copenhagen. My primary focus is on developing new methods for statistical inference and data simulation to address new, challenging questions in evolutionary biology and population genetics.

Beyond research, I dedicate a lot of time to teaching and mentoring students at all levels. Helping promising young scientists push their projects forward is, quite honestly, the most rewarding part of my job.

Previously, I completed my PhD in ancient DNA genomics at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](https://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/index/) in Leipzig where I studied the evolutionary histories of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and anatomically modern humans (as well as extinct elephants!).
