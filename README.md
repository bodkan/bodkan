I did my PhD in ancient DNA genomics at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](https://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/index/) in Leipzig where I studied the evolutionary histories of anatomically modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans (but also extinct elephants!).

I'm currently working at the [Globe Institute](https://globe.ku.dk) at the University of Copenhagen where I'm building new [computational tools](https://bodkan.net/software) for spatial population genetic simulations and data analysis. The underlying themes of my work are reproducibility and design of intuitive user-programmable interfaces to complex computational methods. I enjoy building tools that help experts work on hard problems more efficiently while lowering the barrier of entry to novice users.
