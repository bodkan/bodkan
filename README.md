Iâ€™m an assistant professor at the [Globe Institute](https://globe.ku.dk), University of Copenhagen, specializing in evolutionary and population genomics. The primary focus of [my research](https://bodkan.net/publications) is on [developing methods](https://bodkan.net/software) for statistical inference and data simulation to address challenging new questions across the broad field of evolutionary biology.

Beyond research, I dedicate a lot of time to teaching and mentoring students at all levels. Helping promising young scientists push their projects forward is, quite honestly, the most rewarding part of my job.

I have a PhD in ancient DNA genomics from the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](https://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/index/) in Leipzig where I studied the evolutionary histories of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and anatomically modern humans (as well as extinct elephants!).
