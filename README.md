I'm a [researcher](https://bodkan.net/publications) and [programmer](https://bodkan.net/software) at the [Globe Institute](https://globe.ku.dk), University of Copenhagen. My primary focus is on developing new methods for statistical inference and data simulation in evolutionary biology and population genetics to address challenging questions in evolution and history.

Beyond research, I dedicate a lot of time to mentoring students at all levels, which is, quite honestly, the most rewarding part of my job.

Previously, I completed my PhD in ancient DNA genomics at the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](https://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/index/) in Leipzig where I studied the evolutionary histories of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and anatomically modern humans (as well as extinct elephants!).
